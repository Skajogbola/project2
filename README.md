PawZ is a web application designed for both pet owners and aspiring pet owners. 

There are two main components that compose our application: adoption and rehome.

The adoption feature focuses on a survey with the goal of assisting an individual in identifying what kind of pet would best be suited for their loving home. The rehome feature is for current pet owners who are unable to provide for their pet but want peace of mind knowing that they will be taken care of in their new home. The rehome feature also has a survey so that future owners will have as much information as possible before committing to a new pet.

PawZ strongly believes that the process of rehoming a pet should be safe and straightforward. Our experts are proud to present to you our secure, trusted solution to this problem.
